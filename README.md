MokeSell is an innovative consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of new and second-hand goods. While the platform supports a broad range of product categories, its unique selling proposition (USP) lies in its focus on reducing food waste by promoting the sale of bruised, “ugly,” or slightly damaged produce at discounted prices. This initiative aims to educate consumers on the edibility of such products, encourage sustainable shopping habits, and provide an economic benefit to both buyers and sellers.

Globally, food waste is a major issue, with a significant portion of fruits and vegetables being discarded due to cosmetic imperfections, despite being perfectly safe for consumption. Consumers often overlook these products due to misconceptions about their quality, contributing to unnecessary waste and financial losses for sellers.

Additionally, existing online marketplaces do not specifically incentivize or highlight imperfect but edible produce, making it difficult for buyers who are conscious of food waste to find and purchase such items.

# Unique Features
1. “Ugly” Produce Tagging & Discounts
Sellers can label their produce as "Ugly" if it has cosmetic imperfections but remains safe for consumption.
When a buyer adds an “Ugly” product to their cart, the system automatically applies a 5% discount to the total order.
The cart dynamically checks for eligible products in the database and updates the discount accordingly.

2. Bump System for Increased Visibility
Since older listings gradually lose visibility, sellers of bruised produce receive free or discounted bumps to encourage sales.
This aligns with MokeSell’s broader bump system, where listings are promoted based on payment or engagement.

3. Sustainable Shopping Recognition
Buyers who purchase “Ugly” products earn eco-points that could be used for future discounts.
A carbon footprint tracker shows the environmental impact of reducing food waste.
